Tighten hierarchy. Give each block (“Areas,” “Requirements,” “Versions”) its own card surface with stronger headers, subtle dividers, and 16–20px padding. Use a consistent elevation scale (e.g., base, raised-1) so sections don’t blend together.

Rehome search. Move “Search templates” into the Templates column header and add sort (A–Z, recently edited) and filters (status: Active/Archived, department). Scope the field visually to that column.

Clarify context labels. Rename ambiguous fields: “Department” → “Department for requirements” (if metadata) or “Filter by department” (if it filters the grid). Add helper text under the control stating exactly what changes when it’s set.

Promote primary actions. Restyle “New Template,” “Add requirement,” and “New Version” as primary buttons with higher-contrast fills. Add a persistent footer bar in the editor with “Save” and “Discard” and show last-saved time; support ⌘/Ctrl+S.

Make sections scannable. Add concise section descriptions (one line max). Keep collapse affordances but show item counts in words: “Requirements · 6 roles,” “Areas · 5 selected.”

Refine the Areas control. Replace free-floating chips with a searchable multi-select. Keep color dots for each Area, add “Select all / Clear,” and show a compact legend icon that reveals the color map on hover.

Rework the requirements grid. Set explicit column sizing: Area (flex-grow, min 280), Position (min 220), Quantity (80, right-aligned). Keep the area color dot in-cell. Put “Add requirement” at top-right of the grid, not below it.

Improve grid interactions. Enable inline add (press Enter adds a row), multi-select with Shift/⌘, duplicate row, and bulk delete. Provide row drag to reorder and an optional “Group by Area” toggle.

Validate in-place. Quantity only accepts positive integers; show inline error with short text. Unknown Position shows warning and typeahead suggestions. Prevent losing edits with a leave-guard.

Decode role shorthand. Add tooltips or info chips explaining L1/V1/A1 on hover and a link to a short glossary modal.

Upgrade Versions UX. Replace pagination-like pills with a segmented list showing version name, author, and timestamp (two-line items). Highlight “Current,” allow “Make current,” “Duplicate,” “Compare,” “Rename,” and “Lock.” Keep “New Version” as a primary action.

Breadcrumb and context. Add a breadcrumb above the editor: Events ▸ Templates ▸ Small Event. Include a small “Back to Templates” link near it.

Empty, loading, and error states. For each section, design explicit empty states (e.g., “No requirements yet—add your first role”), skeleton loaders for the table, and friendly retry blocks for fetch errors.

Keyboard and power-user flows. Tab order follows visual order. Typeahead on Area and Position. Shortcuts: ⌘/Ctrl+S save, ⌘/Ctrl+D duplicate row, Delete removes selected rows, ⌘/Ctrl+K focuses template search.

Accessibility. Ensure 4.5:1 contrast on text, visible focus rings, ARIA roles for tabs, lists, and tables, proper labels for chips and dropdowns, and color-blind–safe area colors (don’t rely on color alone; include text labels).

Visual system. Lock an 8px spacing grid, font sizes 12/14/16/20 with 600 weight for section headers, button heights 36–40, card radii 8–12. Define tokens for surface, border, accent, and focus states to keep the theme consistent.

Responsive behavior. At ≤1280px, collapse the Templates list into a drawer; keep the editor full-width with the footer bar sticky. Table columns collapse to two lines per cell and Quantity becomes a stepper.

Performance. Virtualize long template lists and requirement tables. Debounce search. Use optimistic updates for row adds/edits with clear “syncing/saved” states.

Copy cleanup. Make labels noun-first and consistent (“Positions,” “Quantity,” “Selected Areas”). Keep helper text under 80 characters, sentence case, no punctuation unless needed.

Instrumentation and QA. Track time-to-create-template, time-to-add-first-requirement, save errors, undo usage, and bounce from Versions. Set success criteria: new users create a template with 2+ roles in ≤3 minutes, error rate <2%, SUS ≥80.

Rollout plan. Phase 1 (quick wins): promote CTAs, section counts, grid column sizing, footer save bar, tooltips for role codes. Phase 2: Areas control overhaul, versions redesign, keyboard shortcuts, empty/loading states. Phase 3: grouping, diff/compare for versions, optimistic edits, full accessibility pass and performance work.
