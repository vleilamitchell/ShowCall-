 Design a shift template feature. Departments need shifts need to be templatized for easy schedule making. Every department will have a default template which cannot be deleted. If an event does not have a recurring series attached to it, it uses the default template. 

 A shift template consists of a department, a list of areas where the template is active for and a list of positions needed for that shift template. 

 In the case of the default template, whichever areas the event is being planned to use, the positions in those areas are added to the shift on creation (in the case of make schedule) or event selection (if the shift is being created manually).

 The plan should include updating tests, making new tests. 

 Search through the API and UI code for things to reuse.
