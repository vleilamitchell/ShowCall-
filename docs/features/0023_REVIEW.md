# 0023_REVIEW — Contacts Feature

## Summary
- The Contacts feature is largely implemented per the plan. Data model, migration, API routes, client API, UI, and navigation are present and consistent. Normalization and validation reuse existing validators appropriately.
- Small deviations noted: a search box is included in the UI despite "no filters" in the plan; POST does not validate `contactNumber` (PATCH does). These are minor and easy to align either way.

## Review by Plan Sections

### Data Model (Drizzle + SQL)
- `server/src/schema/contacts.ts`: Defines all planned fields with snake_case DB columns and camelCase properties. Exports `Contact` and `NewContact`.
- `server/src/schema/index.ts`: Exports `contacts` in the schema barrel.
- Migration `server/drizzle/0027_create_contacts.sql`: Creates table with columns and PK on `id`, and index on `(last_name, first_name)` as specified.
- Verdict: Pass.

### API (Hono)
- Mounted at `/api/v1/contacts` with `authMiddleware`.
- Endpoints:
  - GET `/contacts`: Lists all contacts ordered by `lastName`, `firstName`.
  - POST `/contacts`: Generates `id`, normalizes empty strings to null, validates `email`, `state`, `postalCode`; normalizes `state`, `postalCode`, `contactNumber`.
  - GET `/contacts/:contactId`: Fetch by id or 404.
  - PATCH `/contacts/:contactId`: Partial update with same normalization; validates fields if present (includes `contactNumber`).
  - DELETE `/contacts/:contactId`: Deletes or 404.
- Mounted before final `app.route('/api/v1', api)`.
- Notes:
  - Validators treat empty values as valid, so optional fields are not over-rejected on POST.
  - POST does not validate `contactNumber` with `isValidPhone` (PATCH does). Either add to POST or leave as-is per "optional" note.
- Verdict: Pass (minor optional enhancement available).

### Client Types and API Client
- `ui/src/lib/serverComm.ts`: Added `ContactRecord` and CRUD helpers (`listContacts`, `createContact`, `getContact`, `updateContact`, `deleteContact`) and attached to exported `api` object.
- Verdict: Pass.

### UI — ListDetail View
- `ui/src/pages/Contacts.tsx`: Implements `ListDetailLayout` with adapter calling the new API.
- Left list label preference: `lastName, firstName` fallback to `email`/`contactNumber`/`id` — matches plan.
- Detail fields (stacked): Prefix, First, Last, Suffix, Address1, Address2, City, State, Zip, Email, Payment Details (textarea), Contact Number — present.
- Includes simple inline create (First/Last/Email) — acceptable ("optional").
- Includes a basic search input that filters client-side. Plan said "no filters"; this is a minor deviation. If strict alignment desired, remove the search UI.
- Light client formatting: uppercase state, 5-digit zip, digits-only phone — aligns with plan guidance.
- Verdict: Pass (with minor deviation re: search).

### Navigation
- Route added: `/contacts` in `ui/src/App.tsx`.
- Sidebar link added in `ui/src/components/appSidebar.tsx`.
- Verdict: Pass.

## Bugs / Risks / Follow-ups
- UI deviation: Search box present despite plan specifying no filters. Decide whether to keep (and update plan) or remove for strict conformance.
- Optional validation: Consider adding `isValidPhone` on POST for symmetry with PATCH.
- Minor unrelated duplication observed in `ui/src/lib/serverComm.ts` for some Areas helper assignments (pre-existing), not part of this feature.

## Conclusion
- Overall implementation quality is good and matches the plan. The feature is usable end-to-end. Only minor alignment tweaks are recommended if strict adherence is required.
