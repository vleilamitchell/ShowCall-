## Code Review: Feature 0005 - Departments (List–Detail)

### Summary
- The Departments feature is implemented end-to-end (DB, schema, API, client, UI) and adheres closely to the plan. Routes are protected by auth, list/search works, inline create is supported, and debounced PATCH is wired for editable fields.
- Data shape alignment across layers is consistent: `id`, `name`, `description`, `updatedAt`.
- Overall code matches existing Events patterns and shared list–detail primitives.

### What matches the plan
- Database
  - Migration `server/drizzle/0002_departments.sql` creates `departments (id text primary key, name text not null, description text null, updated_at timestamptz default now())` and index on `name`.
  - Drizzle schema `server/src/schema/departments.ts` maps `updated_at` -> `updatedAt` and exports types.
- API
  - Mounted under `/api/v1/departments` in `server/src/api.ts`, behind `authMiddleware`.
  - Endpoints implemented: list with `q` filtering on `name`/`description`, create with normalized inputs and UUID generation, get by id, patch with `name` and `description`; `updatedAt` set on PATCH.
- Client
  - `ui/src/lib/serverComm.ts` defines `DepartmentRecord` and helpers: `listDepartments`, `getDepartment`, `createDepartment`, `updateDepartment`; API surface added to exported `api` object.
- UI
  - `ui/src/pages/Departments.tsx` uses shared primitives: `ListDetailLayout`, `List`, `FilterBar`, `CreateInline`, `useListDetail`, `useDebouncedPatch`.
  - Routing added in `ui/src/App.tsx` for `/departments` and `/departments/:departmentId`.

### Correctness and potential issues
- DB/schema
  - OK: Table and Drizzle schema align. Index on `name` is reasonable for ordering/filtering.
- API
  - OK: `q` filter uses `ilike` on both `name` and `description`; ordered by `name ASC` as planned.
  - OK: Create validates `name` and normalizes `description`. ID generation follows Events pattern with global/Node crypto and fallback.
  - OK: Patch sets `updatedAt = new Date()` which maps to `updated_at` in DB.
- Client
  - OK: Types and endpoint URLs match server responses.
- UI
  - OK: Uses `useListDetail` with `resourceKey: 'departments'` enabling route parameter handling for `:departmentId`.
  - OK: Debounced updates for `name` and `description` call server and optimistically update local list.

### Data alignment checks
- Field casing: Server returns `updatedAt`, client type uses `updatedAt?: string`, UI reads only `name`, `description`, and `id`. No snake/camel mismatches observed.
- Payloads:
  - Create: `{ name, description? }` (strings, description optional -> null server-side). Matches.
  - Patch: partial of `{ name, description }`. Matches.

### Style/consistency
- Follows Events feature structure and shared primitives. No over-engineering or unusual style detected.
- Minor consistency nit: Debounced patch apply function signatures include an `AbortSignal` parameter; UI `applyPatch` funcs accept it but do not use it. This is acceptable.

### Recommendations (non-blocking)
1. Consider returning 201 Created on successful POST for both Events and Departments for semantic correctness.
2. Consider adding a composite index on `(lower(name))` or using trigram indexes if search needs to scale; current plan intentionally skipped this for now.
3. In `useListDetail`, selection logic derives route param via string manipulation on `resourceKey`. Add a small helper or explicit param name option if other resources deviate from pluralization conventions.
4. In the UI detail view, render `description` as a textarea if longer text is expected.

### Verdict
- PASS. The implementation meets the plan and acceptance criteria. No blocking issues found.
