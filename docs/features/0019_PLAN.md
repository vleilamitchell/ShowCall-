### Context
Add an Events Calendar view that displays a full-month calendar grid occupying the main content area, with clear navigation controls at the top. Include a new sidebar menu item that follows the same nested pattern as the Inventory → Assets Table entry. The calendar shows events laid out by day and allows navigating months and years.

### Navigation and Routing
- Update `ui/src/components/appSidebar.tsx`:
  - Under the existing `Events` menu entry, add a nested/indented child menu item (reuse the same structure/classes as the `Inventory → Assets Table` nested item) that links to `"/events/calendar"` and is active for that path.
  - Use `isActive('/events/calendar')` for active state and `NavLink to="/events/calendar"`.
  - Label: `Calendar`. Optional icon: reuse `CalendarDays` (consistent with Events) or `CalendarRange` if preferred.

- Update `ui/src/App.tsx` routes:
  - Register a new route: `path="/events/calendar"` with `element={<EventsCalendar />}`.
  - Keep existing `/events` and `/events/:eventId` routes unchanged.

### Page: Events Calendar
- Create `ui/src/pages/EventsCalendar.tsx` with the following responsibilities:
  - **Full-View Layout**: Render a single-month, full grid calendar that fills the main content width.
    - Use `numberOfMonths={1}` and `showOutsideDays={true}`.
    - Ensure the container is responsive (desktop and mobile) and readable.
  - **Top Toolbar (Controls)**: Above the grid, render controls:
    - Prev and Next buttons to move by one month.
    - Today button to jump to the current month.
    - Month and Year dropdowns (caption dropdowns) aligned with the toolbar.
    - Use the shared `Calendar` component (see `ui/src/components/ui/calendar.tsx`) controlled by state.
    - Props for `Calendar`/`DayPicker`: `month`, `onMonthChange`, `captionLayout="dropdown-buttons"`, `fromYear`/`toYear` bounds (e.g., currentYear±5), `numberOfMonths={1}`.
  - **Data Fetch**: Load events for the visible month window. On first render and on month change, compute the current month range and query events in that range.
  - **Day Rendering**: Mark days that have events (dot/badge). Optionally show a small count in the day cell. Keep day cell click behavior simple: no required drill-in beyond the scope of this plan.
  - **Empty/Loading States**: Show a spinner/skeleton while loading; an empty state when no events are present in the visible month.

### Client Data/API Layer
- Update `ui/src/lib/serverComm.ts`:
  - Extend `listEvents` to accept optional `from?: string` and `to?: string` (both `YYYY-MM-DD`), in addition to existing `q`, `status`, `includePast`.
  - Include these params in the querystring when present.
  - Keep `EventRecord` shape unchanged.

- Calendar page data flow (step-by-step algorithm):
  1) Maintain `visibleMonth: Date` state (initialized to `startOfMonth(new Date())`).
  2) Derive `from = startOfMonth(visibleMonth)` and `to = endOfMonth(visibleMonth)` and format as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  3) Call `listEvents({ from, to })` and store results in `events: EventRecord[]`.
  4) Build a `eventsByDate: Record<string, EventRecord[]>` map keyed by `date` to enable fast lookup per day cell.
  5) Provide a `hasEvents(date: Date): boolean` helper that checks `eventsByDate[yyyyMmDd(date)]`.
  6) Pass a `modifiers` object to the `Calendar`/`DayPicker` (e.g., `{ hasEvents }`) and/or customize `CalendarDayButton` to render a dot/count when `hasEvents` is true.
  7) On `onMonthChange(nextMonth)`, update `visibleMonth` which triggers the fetch sequence again.

### Server API (optional but recommended for performance)
- Update `server/src/api.ts` (events routes):
  - In `eventsRoutes.get('/')`, parse optional `from` and `to` query params (strings `YYYY-MM-DD`).
  - If both are present, include a date range filter in the `where` clause: `events.date >= from` and `events.date <= to` (combine with any existing `whereClause` conditions).
  - Preserve existing params behavior (`q`, `status`, `includePast`) and sort order.

### UI Implementation Details
- Use `ui/src/components/ui/calendar.tsx` (react-day-picker based) to get month/year dropdowns and navigation.
- Use existing design tokens/utilities (`cn`, button variants) for consistent styling.
- Visual indicator for event days:
  - Option A: provide a `modifiers` entry (e.g., `hasEvents`) and map it to a class via `classNames` prop.
  - Option B: override the `DayButton`/`CalendarDayButton` render to add a small dot and optional count.
- Accessibility: ensure all controls are keyboard navigable; use semantic buttons for navigation.

#### Top Toolbar wiring
- Maintain `visibleMonth: Date` state.
- Implement:
  - `goPrev = () => onMonthChange(addMonths(visibleMonth, -1))`
  - `goNext = () => onMonthChange(addMonths(visibleMonth, 1))`
  - `goToday = () => onMonthChange(startOfMonth(new Date()))`
- Wire dropdowns to update `visibleMonth` month/year and call `onMonthChange`.

### Files to Add
- `ui/src/pages/EventsCalendar.tsx`

### Files to Modify
- `ui/src/components/appSidebar.tsx` — add nested `Calendar` item under `Events` (same indentation and classes as `Inventory → Assets Table`).
- `ui/src/App.tsx` — register `"/events/calendar"` route with `EventsCalendar`.
- `ui/src/lib/serverComm.ts` — extend `listEvents` signature and querystring handling (`from`, `to`).
- `server/src/api.ts` — accept `from`/`to` query params in events GET and add optional date range filter.

### Notes/Constraints
- Dates are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, so lexicographic range comparison in SQL is safe.
- Keep the calendar read-only for now; creation/edit remains in the existing `Events` page.
- Avoid fetching all events; fetch just the visible month (with optional ±1 month prefetch if desired, out of scope for this initial plan).

### Acceptance Criteria
- A full-month calendar grid renders, filling the main content width.
- A top toolbar provides Prev, Today, Next, and month/year selection.
- Changing month via any control updates the grid and re-fetches events in that range.
- Days with events display a clear indicator (dot or count).
