### Refactor 1 — Phase 2: Authentication and Protected Route Boundary — Review

This review verifies the implementation against the Phase 2 plan, checks for parity with the legacy endpoint, and notes any gaps or risks.

### Plan adherence
- **New controller**: `server/src/controllers/authController.ts` exports `me(c)` which reads `c.get('user')` and returns the legacy-compatible payload shape `{ user, message }`. Matches plan.
- **New route**: `server/src/routes/auth.ts` defines `GET /me` and applies `authMiddleware` at the router boundary via `authRouter.use('*', authMiddleware)`. Matches plan.
- **Auth typing**: `server/src/middleware/auth.ts` augments `ContextVariableMap.user` and exports `AuthenticatedUser`. Matches plan.
- **Router composition**: `server/src/routes/index.ts` mounts both the legacy router and the new auth router under `/api/v1` with `api.route('/protected', authRouter)`. Aligned with the plan’s step to mount side-by-side during cutover.

### Behavioral parity
- **Legacy handler parity**: The legacy `/protected/me` in `server/src/api.ts` returns `{ user, message: 'You are authenticated!' }` and applies `authMiddleware` at the protected router boundary. The new controller returns the same shape and semantics.
- **Integration tests**: `server/src/test/integration/auth.int.ts` covers:
  - Unauthenticated → 401 with `{ error: ... }`.
  - Authenticated (JWT) → 200 with `{ user: { id, email, ... } }`.
  These tests validate the endpoint contract but do not ensure the new router handles the request (see “Gaps”).

### Gaps / risks
- **Legacy handler still present**: `server/src/api.ts` still defines and mounts the legacy `protectedRoutes.get('/me', ...)` under `/protected`. With the current mount order in `routes/index.ts` (legacy first, then new), the legacy route likely handles `/protected/me`, potentially shadowing the new router during tests.
- **No explicit dual-parity assertion**: Tests do not assert that both the legacy and the new router produce identical responses or that the new router is active. As-is, tests can pass even if only the legacy route is serving requests.

### Suggestions
- **Complete the cutover**: Remove the legacy `/protected/me` handler from `server/src/api.ts` and keep the tests unchanged. With `routes/auth.ts` mounted under `/api/v1/protected`, tests should remain green. This completes Phase 2’s exit criteria.
- **Optional parity guard (before removal, if desired)**:
  - Temporarily change mounting order or add a one-off parity test exercising the new router (e.g., by starting the app without `legacyRouter`’s `/protected` subtree or by verifying middleware/router identity in a test-only way). Avoid changing runtime behavior or response shape.
- **Contract clarity**: The `user` object returned is a DB row (snake_case fields like `display_name`, `photo_url`). Tests assert `id` and `email`; UI appears to consume `user`. If future clients require a different shape, consider a DTO layer. For Phase 2, preserving legacy shape is correct.

### Conclusion
Phase 2 is largely implemented as planned: new controller and route exist, middleware is applied at the router boundary, and response semantics match legacy. The remaining action is to remove the legacy `/protected/me` handler in `server/src/api.ts` to finish the cutover and ensure the new router definitively serves `/api/v1/protected/me`.
